Marc's ROI Project

Ideas:
- API call on extra income

Video Tips:
Income - Rental Income, maybe laundry, storage, etc.. (Total Monthly Income) <-- Box 1

Expenses - Taxes, Insurance, Utilities - paid by tenant or landlord?
           (electric, water, sewer, gas, trash), HOA - does it have one?, 
           Lawn/Snow - paid by tenant or landlord?,
           Vacancy - Save around 5% of income, Repairs - not always done, 
           Capital Expenditures - not always done, Property Management - 
           around 10% of the rent, Mortgage <-- Box 2  (Total Monthly Expenses)
           Box 2 has the most common expenses but there can be more or less

Cash Flow - Income minus Expenses (Total monthly cash flow)

Cash on Cash ROI - Down Payment + Closing Costs + Rehab budget + Other = Total Investment
                   Monthly cash flow * 12 = Annual Cash Flow
                   Annual Cash Flow / Total Investment = Cash on Cash ROI
